# Contribution Guidelines
Well, thanks for taking a time to contribute! This is really awesome! :tada:


## How to Contribute?
There are many ways to contribute with this project: from bug reporting to performance/code enhancements, asking for new features, improving documentation...

To do so, first take a look on the [opened issues](https://github.com/jlozovei/developer-titles/issues). If you don't find any that fits your request/problem you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/jlozovei/developer-titles/issues/new) and provide a nice description of what you are asking; technical references (links, reports...) and code samples are always welcome, and they help us to find the better solution for the problems.


## Coding Conventions
Personally I'm not stricted to any `JavaScript Guideline`, but I like to keep nice patterns and use community approved conventions.

So, if you use the project's linting rules and conventions your request will be halfway approved!

Also, if possible, create test cases for your modifications - it's very important to keep the project's quality and assurance of good code!


## Pull Requests
To create a nice PR, follow the [template](https://github.com/jlozovei/developer-titles/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). The goal will always be to maintain/improve the project's quality and fix the existing problems; and to do so, we must keep a pattern.


## Is it your first contribution?
Take a look at the [beginner issues](https://github.com/jlozovei/developer-titles/labels/beginner) and [help wanted issues](https://github.com/jlozovei/developer-titles/labels/help%20wanted), they are a nice way to start.

Either in the project or in the open source community, your contribution will always be welcome. We (the community) will help you to create a nice and worthy contribution!
